# Flickrapi

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.3.21.

A user can search for any word in the search box and an infinate list of photos will appear,
each photo is clickable which opens a modal with the photo title, the image, a description if
it has one and the number of views the photo has had on flickr.

The app is built with Angular 8, it is the framework I use most regularly although I do have experience with AngularJS, React and Vue.

## Install

Run npm i to install dependancies

## Development server

- Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
- Run `ng serve --open` to open browser automatically.
- Add your flickr api key to the environment.ts file in place of API_KEY_HERE

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).
